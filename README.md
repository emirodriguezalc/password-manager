# Week 8: Dictionary-Based Password Manager

You are required to create a dictionary-based password manager using Python programming language. The password manager should be able to store and manage user credentials in a secure manner. It should have a graphical user interface (GUI) created using a GUI library such as Tkinter or PyQt.

## Features
The password manager should have the following features:
- Allow users to create a new account by entering their username and password.
- Allow users to log in to their account using their username and password.
- Allow users to store their website name, website URL, username, and password for each account.
- Allow users to view, edit, and delete their stored account information.
- Implement basic security features such as password strength checking, password hashing, and encryption of stored passwords.

## Documentation
The password manager should also be well-documented with clear comments and instructions.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your Python code along with a document that includes a screenshot of the GUI, a brief description of the password manager's features, and instructions on how to use it.
